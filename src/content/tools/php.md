I have a long history with PHP. I started learning it when it was still at
version 5.2 and faintly remember being excited to refactor all my arrays from
`array()` to `[]` when 5.4 was released.

The language has evolved, my skills have improved and the web development
landscape is vastly different from what it was back then. I don't write a lot of
PHP nowadays, but I still follow updates and notable community members.
Maintaining existing projects also makes me check out what's new every now and
then.

If you're curious about my PHP stack, you should check out [Reun Media PHP app
template](https://github.com/ReunMedia/php-app-template). It might not always be
the latest and greatest, but I try to keep it up to date whenever I discover new
tools and learn new things.
