Anyone who's writing JavaScript today should be writing TypeScript. With
runtimes like [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/) becoming more
popular, recent versions of
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively) supporting
TypeScript natively and transpilers becoming
[faster](https://esbuild.github.io/) and
[faster](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/),
there's simply no excuse to not write TypeScript. There's also
[JSR](https://jsr.io/) package registry for publishing TS packages.
