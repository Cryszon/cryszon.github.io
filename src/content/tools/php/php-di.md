Learning the concept of [dependency
injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) took me a while
back in the day, but it was absolutely worth it. PHP-DI is my preferred DI
container and I like the way it allows me to configure definitions in plain PHP
code instead of using separate configuration files.

Check out [Reun Media PHP App Definitions](https://github.com/ReunMedia/php-app-definitions/) to see how I use it.
