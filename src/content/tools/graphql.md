I prefer GraphQL over REST APIs for DX and consistency compared to the wild west
of REST APIs. The performance boost of querying accross multiple resources and
receiving only what I need is a bonus.

My favorite thing about GrahpQL is client type generation. I get fully typed API
responses without any extra work. Granted, there's a learning curve and the
tooling setup is not always trivial, but as a full stack developer, it feels
great to be able to change something in the back-end and have front-end types
immediately reflect those changes.

I know that there are similar solutions, such as [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), but
GraphQL works better for multi-platform applications and is a more widely used
and robust standard.
